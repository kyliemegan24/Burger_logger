## Installation Instructions
This project is deployed on Heroku, so following this link: https://secure-coast-61532.herokuapp.com/ will lead you to the deployed app. You could also run locally by downloading the files, running an "npm i" in your terminal/gitbash, and then running "node server.js" in your terminal.
## Usage Information
Created burgers are appended to the left-side column of the page, and each burger has a devour button. Created burgers will be added to the databse. Once devoured, the burger will be appended to the right-side devour column of the page, so you can see all of the burgers that you have devoured.
